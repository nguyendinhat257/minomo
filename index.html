                    Surprisingly Abraham really did nothing important
                    in his life.  He was not a great writer, king, inventor 
                    or military leader.  He did nothing except camp out where
                    he was told to go and father a few children.  
                    His name is great only because the children became 
                    nation(s) that kept the record of his life – and then
                    individuals and nations that came from him became great.  
                    This is exactly how it was promised in Genesis 12 
                    (“I will make you into a great nation … I will make 
                    your name great”).  No one else in all history is so 
                    well-known only because of descendants rather than from 
                    great achievements in his own life.
